# From Notebook to Production

This repository shows how to transform a data science project from an exploratory notebook into a structured, production-ready application.

## Description

The project uses a public customer dataset to predict which customers are likely to become leads. This practical case will serve as a guide for implementing some best practices in data science projects.

## Objective

Show step-by-step the process of transforming exploratory code into production code, emphasizing:

- Code modularization
- Configuration management
- Reproducibility
- Maintainability
- Scalability

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer information with demographic, financial, and behavioral features, along with a target variable indicating whether the customer became a lead.
